		.................................................... [Ready Set Go] .................
		Good morning everyone...

		Even though I'm greeting you through a video.
		I'm truly delighted to welcome our students from Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics Engineering Program to this Intellectual Property Awareness Seminar.

		With thesis season fast appraoching, you'll soon be juggling nights, new ideas, and plenty of creativity.
		This seminar is designed to help you see those ideas not just as schoolwork, but as something valuable, something you can protect, develop, and even turn into real-world innovations.

		Intellectual Property or simply IP, may sound technical or even intimidating, but at its heart it's simply about giving credit and protection to your own hard work and originality.
		Think of it as a toolkit that empowers you to move from "this is my project" to "this is my innovation". 

		Today's session is your chance to ask questions, spartk new insights, and plant the seeds of a future patent, startup, or collaboration.
		We're excited to support you on that journey.

		So relax, listen, take notes, and enjoy.
		We're all here to help you grow as engineers and innovators. 

		Thank you for being here, and may you have an inspiring session ahead!
